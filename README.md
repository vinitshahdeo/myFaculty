# MyFaculty

A React app with autocomplete suggestions to search faculty details of VIT University Vellore.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

- `npm install` : Installs the external dependencies used.

- `npm start` : Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `npm test` : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
